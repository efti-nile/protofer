# protofer
Protogens and FER - what could go wrong?

## File Structure

`camera`: a vendor configuration software for the camera.

`data`: the data.

`model_naive`: an unsuccessful attempt to build my own model. I mixed the layers however I felt like.

`model_mobilenet`: an attempt to use MobileNet family for FER. Uses code from [this zoo](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/keras-idiomatic-programmer/tree/master/zoo).

`recorder`: a simple app to record the camera video. Uses VSCode dev containers.
